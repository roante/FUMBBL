# Szieberth Ádám's FUMBBL-related Stuffs

## What is FUMBBL?
[FUMBBL](http://fumbbl.com) is the largest online Blood Bowl
league in the world and is completely free to join. Play
whenever you feel like it, or join one of our many tournaments
and player run leagues - you decide!

## Why this repo?
Currently it contains Group Info codes for my groups on FUMBBL.
I like to keep all of my text based stuff under version control.
Plus the codes can be useful for other members of the community.
